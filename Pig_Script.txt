1)Minimum temperature observed in a given weather station in a particular year:-

temp = load '/user/acadgild/Temperature.csv' using PigStorage(',') as (station:chararray, dateofobs:int, obs:chararray, temperature:int);
filtereddata = FILTER temp by obs == 'TMIN';
groupeddata = GROUP filtereddata by station;
mintemp = FOREACH groupeddata generate (group,MIN(temp.filtereddata));

2)Maximum temperature observed in a given weather station in a particular year:-

temp = load '/user/acadgild/Temperature.csv' using PigStorage(',') as (station:chararray, dateofobs:int, obs:chararray, temperature:int);
filtereddata = FILTER temp by obs == 'TMAX';
groupeddata = GROUP filtereddata by station;
maxtemp = FOREACH groupeddata generate (group,MAX(temp.filtereddata));

3)Number of readings given by each weather station according to the dataset:-

temp = load '/user/acadgild/Temperature.csv' using PigStorage(',') as (station:chararray, dateofobs:int, obs:chararray, temperature:int);
tempdata = GROUP temp by station;
counteddata = FOREACH tempdata generate (group,COUNT(temp.obs));
